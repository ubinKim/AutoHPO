# AutoHPO
For hyperparameter optimization (HPO) in Python

### What is HPO?
Hyperparameter optimization (HPO), also known as hyperparameter tuning, is the process of finding the best combination of hyperparameters for a specific problem that maximizes the model performance. 
AutoHPO uses accuracy as a measure for performance evaluation (i.e., Higher accuracy means better performance).

### Algorithms
Currently, three algorithms are implemented in AutoHPO:

- Grid Search (GS)
- Random Search (RS)
- Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
